# microC_OS_paramultitasking
The task was to create an application which would emulate multitasking in a single process. It can manage input, printing entered values, loading the system with loops and can handle overloads pretty well.

#Origin
Task originates from dr Loska's subject Operational Systems @ Silesian University of Technology. 

#Assumptions
The program should load the system with 3 groups of 5 specific tasks. The communication between them differs. It was meant to show us how different synch methods work under given load and priority of task. 

#OS
The program and its config file is meant to be run in uC/OS. Refer to https://www.osrtos.com/rtos/uc-os-ii/
